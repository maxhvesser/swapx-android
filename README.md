## SwapX - Currency Converter

_SwapX is a simple currency converter app for Android. More or less, what you see is what you get. You are able to select currencies from a list of the most used currencies and convert between them. The project focusses on having a clean code structure and utilizes the latest and greatest tools from the Android SDK, including being built with Compose. This project is an overhaul of my previous project, [Swap]("https://github.com/maxhvesser/swap-android")._
